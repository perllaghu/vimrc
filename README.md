This is the .vim directory I copy everywhere.

It currently includes:

* perlsupport (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=556)
* vim-airline (https://github.com/bling/vim-airline)
* vim-fugitive (https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)

Note that perlsupport requires the following CPAN modules:

* Devel::SmallProf
  [Devel::FastProf]
* Devel::NYTProf
* Devel::Cover
* Perl::Critic
* Perl::Tags
* Perl::Tidy
* Term::ANSIColor
* Test::More
* Test::Strict
* YAPE::Regex::Explain 

INSTALLATION
This is the ~/.vim directory (though you could symlink to it if you wanted)
Then symlink ~/.vimrc to the vimrc file included
